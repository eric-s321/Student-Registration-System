The Student Registration System source code is kept in two directories.
All PL/SQL source code is in the SQL directory.  
If you wish to test PL/SQL code directly without going through the Java interface please navigate to the SQL directory  
and login using the command sqlplus <username>.  You will be prompted for your password.
All Java code is within the Java directory.  Further instructions to run the app are located inside that directory.

Please view the document "Documentation.txt" for a detailed description of all functions and procedures.
